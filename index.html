  <h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
My name is Ira Globus-Harris. I am an Assistant Research Professor at Cornell's Center for Data Science for Enterprise and Society, 
co-hosted by <a href="https://gargnikhil.com/">Nikhil Garg</a> and <a href=https://www.danah.org/>danah boyd</a>. 

My work, which is grounded in the <b>algorithmic foundations of responsible computing</b>,
broadly looks at mechanisms to resolve potential 
harms incurred by AI-driven decision-making. In particular, my work focuses on using algorithmic techniques which are 
<b>scalable for real-world use, holistically consider an algorithm in its broader context</b>, and which <b>flexibly incorporate human input</b>. I am particularly interested in methods which provide 
flexibility to adjust models after deployment in scalable and efficient ways. 

<p>
I received my PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/">Aaron 
  Roth</a> and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/">Michael Kearns</a>
    Prior to Penn, I worked at Boston University as a 
    software engineer with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/hic/centers-initiatives-labs/sail/">SAIL</a> and with the <a href=https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/>Harvard Privacy Tools Project</a>. I received my Bachelor's degree from
    Reed College in Portland, OR.
