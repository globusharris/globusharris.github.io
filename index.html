<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>

My name is Ira Globus-Harris, and I am a second year PhD student in the computer and information sciences department at the University of Pennsylvania, co-advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/">Aaron Roth</a> and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/">Michael Kearns</a>. My research focuses on questions relating to ethics in computer science, particularly differential privacy and fairness, and  I am currently an intern at Amazon AWS. Prior to Penn, I worked at Boston University as a software engineer with SAIL and with the Harvard Privacy Tools Project. I got my bachelors from Reed College in Portland, OR.

<h1> Advocacy </h1> 

<p>
I am the president of the Penn school of engineering and applied sciences' group for LGBTQ+ graduate students, Engiqueers, and am a diversity council representative for the computer and information theory department for the school of engineering and applied sciences. While at Penn, I have led and advocated for several changes for trans inclusion within the school and the university more broadly. At Reed, I co-led the group for gender minorities in STEM fields, <a href="https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2017/stem-gems-mural.html">STEMGeMs</a>. I also designed curriculum and taught a <a href="https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2018/math-cs-outreach.html">computer science outreach program</a> to a local elementary school while at Reed, and painted some <a href="https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2017/stem-gems-mural.html"> fun murals </a> which have now inspired some other <a href="https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2021/stafford-bio-mural.html">fun murals</a> (plus another set that I believe are currently in progress in the Chemistry building).
